I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) at the University of Ottawa (UOttawa). I am also a Volunteer Visitor at the National Research Council Canada (NRC). I am working under the supervision of professor Miodrag Bolic from UOttawa and Dr. Iraj Mantegh from NRC. I am interested in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning fields and their applications in Autonomous Vehicles. Now, I am dealing with moving objects detection and tracking in videos. I am also curious about Self-Supervised Learning and Interpretable DL.
Previously, I obtained a M.Sc of Biomedical Engineering in the Electrical Engineering department at the Sharif University of Technology (SUT). I have also a B.Sc. of Electical Engineering at the Babol Noshirvani University of Technology.

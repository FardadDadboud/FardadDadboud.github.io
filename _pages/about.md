I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://engineering.uottawa.ca/school-EECS" target="_blank">School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS)</a> at the University of Ottawa (UOttawa). I am also a Volunteer Visitor at the <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en" target="_blank">National Research Council Canada (NRC)</a>. I am working under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.uottawa.ca/people/bolic-miodrag" target="_blank">Professor Miodrag Bolic</a> from UOttawa and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/iraj-mantegh" target="_blank">Dr. Iraj Mantegh</a> from NRC.

I am interested in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning fields and their applications in Autonomous Vehicles. Now, I am dealing with moving objects detection and tracking in videos. I am also curious about Self-Supervised Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

Previously, I obtained a M.Sc of Biomedical Engineering in the Electrical Engineering department at the Sharif University of Technology (SUT). I have also a B.Sc. of Electical Engineering at the Babol Noshirvani University of Technology.

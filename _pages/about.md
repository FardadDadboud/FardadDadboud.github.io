Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Ottawa's <a href="https://engineering.uottawa.ca/school-EECS" target="_blank">School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS)</a>. In addition to my academic pursuits, I volunteer as a Visitor at Canada's <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en" target="_blank">National Research Council (NRC)</a>. My research is supervised by <a href="https://engineering.uottawa.ca/people/bolic-miodrag" target="_blank">Professor Miodrag Bolic</a> at the University of Ottawa.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning, with a specific focus on autonomous vehicles. Currently, I'm deeply engaged in addressing challenges related to domain shift, out-of-distribution detection, and unsupervised or test-time domain adaptation.

I hold a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Babol Noshirvani University of Technology.

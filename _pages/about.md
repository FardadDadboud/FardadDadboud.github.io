Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Ottawa's <a href="https://engineering.uottawa.ca/school-EECS" target="_blank">School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS)</a>, under the supervision of <a href="[https://engineering.uottawa.ca/people/bolic-miodrag](https://www.carg-uottawa.com/people/miodrag-bolic)" target="_blank">Professor Miodrag Bolic</a>. Alongside my academic work, I serve as a Visiting Researcher at Canadaâ€™s <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en" target="_blank">National Research Council (NRC)</a>.

My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and agentic AI, with a particular focus on drone-based perception systems for autonomous and safety-critical applications. I am currently developing robust multi-view, multi-object tracking and 3D localization methods using moving cameras, with an emphasis on multi-modal sensor fusion and uncertainty quantification to address domain shifts, out-of-distribution detection, and test-time adaptation in object detection and tracking. In parallel, I investigate the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) within agentic and multi-agent frameworks. My recent work also extends to time-series analysis and algorithmic trading, where I applied agentic AI to design intelligent pipelines for signal forecasting.

I hold a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Babol Noshirvani University of Technology.

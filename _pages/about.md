Right now, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the University of Ottawa's <a href="https://engineering.uottawa.ca/school-EECS" target="_blank">School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS)</a>. In addition to my academic work, I spend time each week as a Volunteer Visitor at Canada's <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en" target="_blank">National Research Council (NRC)</a>. <a href="https://engineering.uottawa.ca/people/bolic-miodrag" target="_blank">Professor Miodrag Bolic</a> at the University of Ottawa and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/iraj-mantegh" target="_blank">Dr.Â Iraj Mantegh</a> at the National Research Council of Canada are supervising my research.

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning as they pertain to autonomous vehicles. Right now I'm focusing on video object detection and tracking. The concept of Meta-Learning fascinates me as well.

Previously, I attended Sharif University of Technology's Electrical Engineering department to earn a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering. Additionally, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Babol Noshirvani University of Technology.
